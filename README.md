# Bike Sharing Assignment
> Outline a brief description of your project.


## Table of Contents
* EDA
* First Model training by sklearn
* Model evaludation with stats model
* Feature filtering and selection
* Final model training and evaluation
* Results or Conclusions

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
1. In bad weather, bookings drop significantly, there is nothing we can do about it but plan accordingly
2. Spring season negatively impact the booking, can plan for alternate routes/localities which are uneffected in the spring season
3. There are certain months November, December and July (probably by weather) when bookings are low
4. Humidity and windspeed negatively impacts the booking
5. On other side, higher temperature promotes bookings
6. And bookings are high on working day and year-on-year growth on top of it
